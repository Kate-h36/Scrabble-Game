## Rules of the Game 

in the game of Scrabble, players create words to score points, 
and the number of points is the sum of the point values of each letter in the word.
For example, if we wanted to score the word `Code`
you would note that in general Scrabble rules, character `ะก` is worth `3`points
the `o` is worth `1` point, the `d` is worth `2` points 
and the `e` is worth `1` point
Summuring this you get that word `Code` is worth `3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7` points.

## Quick Start

1. Enter the words played by Player 1 and press Enter.
2. Enter the words played by Player 2 and press Enter.
3. The program will compute and print the score for each player and declare the winner.
